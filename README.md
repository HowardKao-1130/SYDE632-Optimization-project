# SYDE632-Optimization-project

This was a course project on improving SVM performance in imbalanced dataset use cases, simplified and taken from a private repo. 

The approach was novel and manually implemented (as required), but inefficient in retrospect. 

Empirical improvement on cancer dataset (starting point being the stopping point of initial training):
